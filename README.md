Collaborative Playlists for Youtube

BETA:       https://playlistah.herokuapp.com/
RELEASE:    https://playlistah.davegabe.it/

## Features

- Create playlists:     Choose a name and create or join a playlist.
- Add videos:           Directly search on YouTube and add videos!
- Remove videos:        If you're a guest, you can remove only your videos. If you're the admin, you can remove everything. It's all about power.

- **New stuff**
- Youtube Player:       You can directly play the playlist!
- Temporary playlists:  Ephemeral playlists? Thats it! Just add, play and see the videos disappear one by one. Enjoy the ephemerality! (Yah, it's also useful for streamers... I guess)
- Sockets:              When someone changes something in the playlist, you'll directly get the update.
